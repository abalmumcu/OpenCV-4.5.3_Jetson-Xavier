# OpenCV-4.5.3_Jetson-Xavier

This repository aims to upgrade the default OpenCV version 4.1.1 (for Jetpack 4.6) on the Jetson Xavier platform to OpenCV 4.5.3 with CUDA support. The upgrade enables you to leverage the latest features and optimizations provided by OpenCV and utilize GPU acceleration for computationally intensive tasks.

## Motivation

The default OpenCV version provided with Jetpack 4.6 may not include the most recent bug fixes, features, or performance improvements available in newer versions. This repository provides a step-by-step guide and scripts to help you upgrade to OpenCV 4.5.3 with CUDA support, ensuring that you can take advantage of the latest advancements in computer vision.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the upgrade process, ensure that you have the following:

- NVIDIA Jetson Xavier Developer Kit
- Jetpack 4.6 or later installed on your Jetson Xavier
- Basic knowledge of the Jetson Xavier platform and building software from source

## Installation

To upgrade OpenCV on your Jetson Xavier to version 4.5.3 with CUDA, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/abalmumcu/OpenCV-4.5.3_Jetson-Xavier.git`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd OpenCV-4.5.3_Jetson-Xavier`
3. Run the provided setup script to install dependencies: `./setup.sh`
4. Wait for the script to complete the installation process. This may take some time, as it involves downloading dependencies, compiling the source code, and configuring the system.
5. Once the installation is finished, verify the OpenCV version by running: `python3 -c "import cv2; print(cv2.__version__)"`. It should display "4.5.3".

## Usage

After successfully upgrading OpenCV, you can start using the new version in your projects. Update your code or scripts to import and utilize OpenCV 4.5.3 with CUDA features. Make sure to adjust any relevant build configurations or dependencies in your projects to align with the upgraded version.
